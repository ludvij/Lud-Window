# Lud-Window
A window adpater/middleman made to interface with external libraries

## Current implementations
 - SDL2: up to date
 - SDL3: up to date
 - Win32: up to date

## Requirements
Per the original design, these are made to work exclussively with imgui and vulkan, ideally i'd like to remove that
dependency and let the application or the renderer handle that, but rn I'm in no rush.
